		<h2>Home Page</h2>
		<p>My name is Brendon Young and I have a wonderful wife and son to enjoy life 
		with. I am currently attending Brigham Young University - Idaho as an online 
		student working on a BA in Web Design and Development.  I enjoy working with 
		computers and building websites, but more so working with web businesses and
		SEO (Search Engine Optimization).  Programming and design is enjoyable for me.
		In my spare time I enjoy family outings, playing League of Legends and reading.  
		I consider myself hard working and dedicated to any task that needs completed.  
		This website is where all of the assignments for CS 313 will be found.</p>
